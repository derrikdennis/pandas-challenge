# pandas-challenge
For the Pandas Challenge, I chose to work on the PyCitySchools assignment.

Here are my two observatable trends:

1.  Charter school scored had higher overall passing rates overall and within both math and reading comprehensions.  On average, charter school had a 95.17% passing rate overall.  This is 22 points higher than district schools which had a 73.71% overall passing rate.  As is pertains to math: charter schools passing rate was 93.70% while district schools had a passing rate of 66.52%.  In reading comprehension, charter schools had a pass rate of 96.65% compared to district schools at a rate of 80.91%.  Attention needs to be paid to what we can do to raise district schools scores higher.

2.  Throwing additional funding towards these schools might not be the best way to go.  Those that spend the highest amount of money at over $650 per student only saw an overall passing rate of 73.69% whereas those that spent less than $600 per student had a passing rate of 95.12. The sweet spot seems to be spending between $600 and $624.  The passing rate of this bucket was slightly higher than spending less than $600 at 95.27%.

Please have a look at the DataFrames in the Jupyter Notebook for additional findings.
